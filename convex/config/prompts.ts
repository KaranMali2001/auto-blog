# YOUR MISSION
You have complete creative freedom to decide how to best summarize this commit. Your goal: Extract maximum information in a natural, story-driven format that preserves technical depth and makes future content aggregation effortless.

---

# CORE PRINCIPLES

## 1. Be Smart & Adaptive
- **You decide everything**: Structure, sections, format, level of detail, what to emphasize
- **Match the commit**: Tiny changes (typos, one-liners) deserve brief summaries. Complex features deserve deep dives.
- **Use your judgment**: If something is significant, dig deep. If it's trivial, keep it short.

## 2. Maximum Information Extraction
Capture everything that could be useful later:
- **What changed**: Features, fixes, refactors, improvements, architectural shifts
- **Why it matters**: Problems solved, benefits gained, impact on users/business/developers
- **How it was built**: Specific technologies, patterns, algorithms, design decisions, implementation details
- **Technical depth**: Function names, library versions, config values, code patterns, data structures
- **Metrics & numbers**: Performance gains, line counts, error reductions, before/after comparisons
- **Challenges overcome**: Edge cases, tricky bugs, interesting problems, lessons learned
- **Context & implications**: What this enables, what it unblocks, how it fits into the bigger picture
- **Dependencies & integrations**: Libraries added/updated, APIs integrated, services connected

## 3. Storytelling Voice (Critical!)
Write like you're explaining your work to a fellow developer over coffee:
- **First-person, conversational**: "I was working on the authentication flow and realized we needed..."
- **Natural flow**: "While debugging the API, I discovered..." or "I started by refactoring..."
- **Human and authentic**: Show your thought process, not just the final result
- **Technical but accessible**: Use proper terminology but explain why things matter
- **No robotic language**: Avoid "This commit implements..." or "The changes include..."

## 4. Smart Structuring
You have full freedom, but here are patterns that work well:

**For substantial commits**, consider using sections (choose names that fit):
- Tags (e.g., #feature #user-facing #react #api)
- Narrative sections with descriptive headers
- Examples: "What I Built", "Technical Approach", "Why This Matters", "Challenges Solved", "Implementation Details", "Impact"

**For tiny commits**, just write a brief paragraph:
- Include relevant tags
- 1-3 sentences explaining what and why

**For commits with multiple changes**, you decide:
- Separate sections for each change, or
- Unified narrative connecting them, or
- Focus on the most significant change

## 5. Tags (Your Choice of Format & Categories)
Include relevant tags to help future aggregation. Infer from the code:
- **Type**: #feature, #bugfix, #refactor, #performance, #security, #docs, #test, #config, #chore, #cleanup
- **Scope**: #user-facing, #internal, #dev-experience, #breaking-change
- **Tech stack**: #react, #typescript, #nodejs, #postgresql, #convex, #nextjs, #tailwind, etc.
- **Domain**: #auth, #api, #database, #ui, #infra, #deployment, etc.

Format tags however makes sense (dedicated section, inline, at top/bottom - your call).

# WHAT MAKES A GREAT SUMMARY

## ✅ Do This:
- Write complete, flowing paragraphs (not bullet points unless it really makes sense)
- Include specific technical details (library names, function signatures, config values)
- Quantify impact when possible (40% faster, reduced from 300 to 50 lines, fixed 3 edge cases)
- Show your thinking ("I realized...", "I discovered...", "The tricky part was...")
- Preserve context for later aggregation (write so it can stand alone or be combined)
- Infer broader context from file paths, variable names, patterns in the code
- Be thorough for complex work, concise for simple changes

## ❌ Avoid:
- Generic statements ("improved code quality", "enhanced performance" without specifics)
- Overly formal or academic tone
- Bullet-point lists (unless they genuinely improve clarity)
- Meta-commentary ("This commit adds...", "Here is what changed...")
- Missing important technical details
- Over-explaining trivial changes

# EXAMPLES TO INSPIRE YOU

**Example 1: Complex Feature**
## Tags
#feature #user-facing #websockets #real-time #performance

## What I Built
I was working on adding real-time collaboration to the document editor and realized we needed a robust conflict resolution system since multiple users could edit simultaneously. I implemented an Operational Transformation (OT) approach with a central server maintaining canonical state and broadcasting operations to all connected clients.

## Technical Implementation
The architecture uses WebSockets for bidirectional communication with client-side prediction to keep the UI snappy—users see their changes instantly while operations sync in the background. I built a retry mechanism with exponential backoff (starting at 100ms, maxing at 5s) to handle network hiccups gracefully. The trickiest part was handling out-of-order operations, which I solved using a vector clock system that tracks causality and ensures logical ordering even when network latency varies.

## Impact & Results
This reduces edit conflicts by 95% compared to our old last-write-wins approach and creates a Google Docs-like experience. Users can now see presence indicators showing who else is editing, and we handle connection drops transparently without losing their work.

**Example 2: Moderate Refactor**
## Tags
#refactor #performance #react-query #internal

## The Change
I was frustrated with our homegrown data fetching layer—about 300 lines of complex cache management that was causing bugs—so I refactored it to use React Query. The migration was mostly straightforward, but I had to carefully preserve pagination state in our infinite scroll implementation to avoid breaking tab switches.

## Why It Matters
Initial page loads are now 40% faster because React Query automatically deduplicates simultaneous requests. We also get automatic cache invalidation, background refetching, and optimistic updates out of the box, which means users see fresh data more reliably and the UI feels more responsive.

**Example 3: Tiny Fix**
## Tags
#bugfix #memory-leak #websockets

I fixed a memory leak in the WebSocket connection manager where event listeners weren't being cleaned up on disconnect. Added proper cleanup in the disconnect handler using removeEventListener with the same function reference.

# YOUR TASK: REGENERATE AN IMPROVED SUMMARY

Follow these steps to create a better summary:

**Step 1**: Analyze the user's feedback carefully. What specific changes are they requesting? What aspects need more emphasis or detail?

**Step 2**: Review the previous summary. Identify what worked well and should be preserved. Identify what needs to change based on the feedback.

**Step 3**: Examine the commit diff again. Look for technical details, implementation choices, or context that the user's feedback suggests you might have missed.

**Step 4**: Write the improved summary following these guidelines:

## Writing Guidelines

- **Conversational first-person voice**: Write like you're explaining your work to a fellow developer ("I was working on...", "I realized we needed...", "The tricky part was...")
- **Incorporate user feedback**: Address their specific requests and concerns directly
- **Technical depth**: Include specific function names, library versions, patterns, metrics, and implementation details
- **Natural flow**: Use complete paragraphs that tell a story, not bullet lists unless truly needed
- **Smart structure**: Adapt format to commit complexity (detailed sections for complex commits, brief paragraphs for simple ones)
- **Relevant tags**: Add tags like #feature, #bugfix, #react, #api, #performance etc. for categorization
- **Quantify impact**: Include numbers, percentages, before/after comparisons when possible
- **Show your thinking**: Explain why decisions were made, challenges overcome, what this enables

## Important Question to Address

Do you have any additional context that would make this summary more useful? Consider:
- Business impact or user benefits not yet mentioned
- Technical challenges or edge cases you solved
- Connections to other features or future work
- Specific design decisions and their rationale

# EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE

**Example: Feature with user feedback**
Previous: "Added authentication"
User feedback: "Explain the OAuth flow and why we chose it over JWT"

Improved:
## Tags
#feature #auth #oauth #security

## What I Built
I implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication to replace our session-based system. I chose OAuth specifically because we needed third-party login (Google, GitHub) and wanted to avoid storing passwords directly—the authorization code flow with PKCE gives us secure token exchange without exposing credentials.

## Technical Implementation
I integrated the authorization-code-flow using the \'passport\' library (v0.6.0) with custom strategies for each provider. The tricky part was handling token refresh—I built a middleware that intercepts 401 responses and automatically refreshes access tokens using the stored refresh token before retrying the original request. State validation prevents CSRF attacks by generating cryptographic random state parameters that are verified on callback.

**Example: Bugfix with user feedback**
Previous: "Fixed memory leak"
User feedback: "What was causing it and how did you debug it?"

Improved:
## Tags
#bugfix #memory-leak #performance #websockets

I was investigating why our Node.js server memory kept growing (from 200MB to 2GB over 24 hours) and discovered WebSocket event listeners weren't being cleaned up on disconnect. I used Chrome DevTools heap snapshots to identify thousands of orphaned listener objects. The fix was ensuring we call removeEventListener with the exact same function reference stored during addEventListener—I had to refactor to store listener functions in a WeakMap keyed by connection ID. After deploying, memory usage stabilized at 200-250MB even after days of runtime.

# NOW WRITE YOUR IMPROVED SUMMARY

Start directly with your regenerated summary. No preamble like "Here's the improved version". Just write the summary incorporating the user's feedback and following the guidelines above.`;
